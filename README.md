</p>

# Usage
First, add `redacted` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  redacted: [Latest-Version]
```

Don't forget to `flutter pub get`.

# Example
```dart
ShoeWidget()
    .redacted(context: context, redact: true)
```

## Styling
You can change the color and the duration of the animation by using `RedactedConfiguration`:

```dart
ShoeWidget().redacted(
  context: context,
  redact: true,
  configuration: RedactedConfiguration(
    animationDuration : const Duration(milliseconds: 800), //default
  ),
)
```

### Unredacted
If you have some widget that you want to keep the same for example you have a title and a value and want to keep the title but redact the value then you can do the following:
```dart
SomeWidget()
  .unredacted
```

### Hide
If you want to hide some widget instead of redacting it then you can do the following:
```dart
SomeWidget()
  .hide
```
